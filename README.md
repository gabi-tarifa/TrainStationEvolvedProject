# TrainStationEvolvedProject

For everyone who found my github, welcome y'all!!

This project tries to remake (with upgrades and mix of features, of course) one of Pixel Federation's biggest game sucess ever: TrainStation - Game on Rails, mixed with some feature from TrainStation 2 and TrainStation 3, as well some exclusive features.

Key Features:
- You'll be able to send a train for a destination, with multiple options with different time travels, or customize your own and take the proportionally equivalent from those predefined destinations;
- You'll be able to send a train for multiple jobs destinations, don’t matter if the train was already send to other job or not. However, the time remaining will be added (or substituted) to the new time travel;
- You won’t build a cargo and a passenger train from the same locomotive, and neither the cargo or passenger train will collect and deliver the resources at the same time. However you may use the same train, scheduling it to send the resources right after it collected them all;
- There will be factories at the station that enable some materials, that wouldn’t be obtained via cargo trains, to be collected, delivered for contract jobs, or used for other materials production;
- Every locomotive category will have it's own properties, bonus and disadvantages, manage them appropriately;
- There will be connectivity with other types transportation, like airports, ports and highway terminals, and each of them will have its bonus as well;
- Locomotives can be bought, upgraded, sold or dismantled;
- Trains can be automatically built or by the player, according to necessity and efficiency at the time;
