# TrainStationEvolvedProject

## For everyone who found my github, welcome y'all!!

This project tries to remake (with upgrades and mix of features, of course) one of Pixel Federation's biggest game sucess ever: TrainStation - Game on Rails, mixed with some feature from TrainStation 2 and TrainStation 3, as well some exclusive features.

## Key Features:
* The game will be 3D, with guiding camera with both arrow keys or cursor, and pressing shift while guiding rotates the camera
* You'll be able to send a train for a destination, with multiple options with different time travels, or customize your own and take the proportionally equivalent from those predefined destinations;
* You'll be able to send a train for multiple jobs destinations, don’t matter if the train was already send to other job or not. However, the time remaining will be added (or substituted) to the new time travel;
* You won’t build a cargo and a passenger train from the same locomotive, and neither the cargo or passenger train will collect and deliver the resources at the same time. However you may use the same train, scheduling it to send the resources right after it collected them all;
* There will be factories at the station that enable some materials, that wouldn’t be obtained via cargo trains, to be collected, delivered for contract jobs, or used for other materials production;
* Every locomotive category will have it's own properties, bonus and disadvantages, manage them appropriately;
  * Steam locomotives are more powerfull in general, but doesn't have any profit bonus.
  * Diesel locomotives have 45% profit bonus for all wagons, but they have slightly less power in general;
  * Electric locomotives grant a whopping 100% profit bonus for gold generation, but they are as powerfull as diesel trains;
  * Maglev locomotives' wagons have a absurd high profit bonus, however these locomotives are way less powerfull in terms of wagon carring;
  * Hyperloop locomotives give exclusive materials, which are essential for specific factories materials, which wouldn’t be obtained by any other locomotives. However, the don’t have any profit bonus, such as Steam locomotives. 
* There will be connectivity with other types transportation, like airports, ports and highway terminals, and each of them will have its bonus as well;
* Locomotives can be bought, upgraded, sold or dismantled, you mustn't dismantle a train which only has a limited ammount;
* Trains can be automatically built or by the player, according to necessity and efficiency at the time;

## How is it going??

The project now is advancing pretty well, all set destinations are instanced (needs customization, but soon each destiny will have it's own characteristics :) ), some trains and materials are instanced, so i can test then and fix/improve then

## Things to do

The project gonna need a database, so i can save all the data for one user, but i focus on that later;
It needs a definitive formula for material and gold generation, both for collect and delivery functions;
Find a way to connect the 3D models found on web to unity, so i can start modeling them. 

## Note

I know the README is incomplete and etc, and the code is in its starter and simplest composition, and someday soon it'll be improved :)
